Suggestions are welcome, but this is my personal setup. So I may not merge your
pull request in behalf of my personal workflow.

If you are looking for a less opinionated setup, take a look at:

* [VIM Bootstrap](http://vim-bootstrap.com/)
* [SPF13-VIM](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)

If you really think you can do something better using my setup as a bootstrap,
**fork it!** :fork_and_knife:
